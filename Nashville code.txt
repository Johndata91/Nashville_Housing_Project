QUESTION 1 

SELECT * FROM Nashville_Housing

-- How does the number of bedrooms relate to the property's total value?

	SELECT ROUND(CAST(CORR(bedrooms,totalvalue)AS NUMERIC), 2) as correlation
		FROM Nashville_Housing;
 
 ANSWER
-- This simply indicated a moderate correlation between bedrooms and total value
-- That is if the number of bedrooms increase total value tend to increase 
-- On average, properties with more bedrooms tend to be more valuable, 
 --but the relationship is not strong enough to make bedroom count the sole predictor of a property's value. 
-- Other factors, such as location, square footage, condition, and amenities, 
-- may also play significant roles in determining property values."



QUESTION 2 

--Do properties with more bathrooms tend to have higher sale prices?

	SELECT ROUND(CAST(CORR(fullbath,saleprice)AS NUMERIC), 2) as correlation
		FROM Nashville_Housing;
ANSWER
-- There is a weak positive relationship between the number of full bathrooms in a property and its sale price. 
--On average, properties with more full bathrooms tend to have slightly higher sale prices, but the influence of the number of full bathrooms on the sale price is not significant. 
--Other factors, such as location, square footage, condition, and market demand, may have a more substantial impact on property sale prices."
--The correlation value simply means fullbath is not a strong predictor of sale price.


QUESTION 3 

--Is there a relationship between the year built and the total property value?

	SELECT ROUND(CAST(CORR(yearbuilt,totalvalue)AS NUMERIC), 2) as correlation
		FROM Nashville_Housing;
		
ANSWER

--There is a relatively weak positive relationship between the year a property was built and its total value. 
--On average, newer properties tend to have higher values, but this relationship is not strong, and other factors play a substantial role in determining property values."
